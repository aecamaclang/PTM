Expert Name:,,,"INSTRUCTIONS: For each ecological group and for the healthy prairie landscape, please provide:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enter your name here,,,1. Your BEST guess (the most likely) estimate of the probability of persistence under the Baseline and each Strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,2. Your estimate of the LOWEST plausible (most pessimistic) probability of persistence under each management scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Probability of persistence of Species/Ecological Group 
the chance that populations in the region will be viable, self-sustaining, and able to perform ecological functions over 25 yrs",,,3. Your estimate of the HIGHEST plausible (most optimistic) probability of persistence under each management scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Refer to the probability scale on the right when making your estimates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,NOTE: You do NOT have to give an estimate for every ecological group and/or strategy. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Probability of persistence of Healthy Prairie Landscape 
the chance that we will continue to have a prairie landscape in the region that has the structural and functional diversity needed to support the full diversity of flora and fauna in the region, with individual sites that are large enough and in good condition to maintain soil and ecosystem function and the provision of ecosystem services, and that are well-connected and allow for wildlife movement, over 25 years",,,"If you do not feel confident making an estimate, please put an 'X' in the cell. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"If you think the management strategy will have no impact, use 'B' to indicate that the estimate is the same as for the Baseline",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ESTIMATE IF THE CELL CHANGES TO ONE OF THESE COLOURS:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,If Strategy estimate < Baseline estimate,,,,If Combined Strategy < ANY of the Individual strategies,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"This suggests that you believe the Strategy will be worse than the Baseline (business-as-usual or no additional management). If this is NOT the case, please review and adjust your estimate accordingly",,,,"This suggests that you believe implementing the combined strategy will be worse than implementing one of the strategies in the combination. If this is NOT the case, please review and adjust your estimates accordingly",,,,,,,,,,,,,
